# Make_Your_Own_API_Mashup

The challenge consists in writing a function that takes a string repr. of a meal type and a location as inputs.
The location must be geocoded (Google Maps API) and then pass the latitude and longitude coordinates to the foursquare API.
Then parse the JSON response and return the first restaurant.
